                <h2>About Guruji</h2>
                <p>Tapasvi Shri Chaitanya Guruji was born in Andhra Pradesh to a theist family. Since childhood, he was a very active student and mindful, later accomplished success in his business and earned fame and money. But even after blooming in his life and career, he felt voidness within his heart. The feeling that “something is missing” always disturbed him and did not let him achieve internal peace. </p>
                <p>To evacuate this melancholy from his heart and in search of internal peace, he decided to leave the materialism and started hardcore meditation and prayer. After profound ascetism and meditation he achieved the self-contemplation and supreme knowledge.</p>
                <p>According to Guruji yoga is the best way to attain both physical and mental health.

            <p>To all my dear Souls,</p>
         <p>Today entire world is living an animal-like life, full of selfishness aria envy, thinking that momentary pleasure is everything, neglecting the divine power residing in human & leaving behind the time tested principles of religion, humanity, humbleness and 'yoga'. In this world, humanity is degenerated by tangles of desires &       pleasures. Entire universe is under the deadly tension of insecure feeling.

 necessary to remove this danger and establish peace. In this period of science and
 technology, it is our sole aim to use inventions and discoveries for the betterment of
 human race and to bring peace and pace in human life in this computer age.
        </p>
        <p>
     Today we all should move together to establish peace and harmony in the entire         world. Abandoning selfishness, ego, jealousy, and inculcating feeling of equality,
world. Abandoning selfishness, ego, jealousy, and inculcating feeling of equality,
 following the principle of "truth always triumphs" we have to establish the habit of
 'Sadhana' and 'virtues'. In this important 'movement' all should work to move to protect
 virtue in one direction carrying the flag of 'peace and harmony'. This will inculcate the
 very power in human being, which makes him incarnation of God. In the world many
 great people have risen to the position of gods by generation of great thoughts and
 deeds.
     </p>
     <p>
     By this 'Sahaj Siddh Yoga' program, the immunity of body increases, one attains
 peace and patience of mind and gets rid of mental agonies, indecisiveness and other
 weaknesses. We are living a life of disturbance, disease, ignorance, selfishness, which
 is animalistic. To remove this and attain virtuous progress there is only one path and that is the ancient 'Manoyog Sadhana'. By this Manoyog Sadhana', man removes all
 is the ancient 'Manoyog Sadhana'. By this Manoyog Sadhana', man removes all
 ignorance in him and perceives God in himself. This self realization is called salvation.
 </p>
            <div class="ver-spacer"></div>

<h3 class="text-center">
    "Meditation is the form of energy, <br>
    and it's toil is the form of God"
</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6">
            

     <p>By adopting this truth, in life, mental peace will be generated and man will lead a
 healthy and happy life. Every human being has immense power hidden in him and man
 is utilizing only 2 percent of it. Great scientists who have achieved noble prizes, even areable to use this power only 6 to 10 percent. eable to use this power only 6 to 10 percent.</p>
     <p>Human body is a mystery machine. This is the most important machine in the
 universe and is the origin of the entire word. One can perceive the Almighty by
 upgrading this machine through `Sadhana'. By 'Sadhana' one attains peace, health and
 blissful life.</p>
     <p>The origin of 'Vedas' is related to the path of religion. Religion of 'Vedas' is
 religion of human beings. In 'Vedas' there are two different paths, which we are not able
 to differentiate. One is Aparal and other is 'Para' knowledge. Mere practice of religious
 rituals is 'Apara' knowledge. Practice of 'Sadhana' is 'Para' knowledge. If a man follows
 the path of `Apara) knowledge, he won't be able to raise himself from the level of ordinary human being and if he follows path of 'Para' knowledge, he is going to attain good moral
 human being and if he follows path of 'Para' knowledge, he is going to attain good moral
 character and godly virtues. If a man wants to release himself from cycle of birth and

            death, then 'Sadhana' should be his goal to attain salvation. 'Manoyog Sadhana' is the only path we have to follow to attain peace and' harmony, to show right direction to society. A person can follow 'Sadhana' leading a normal family life, a young person can follow it along with his studies and there by achieving the Truth. 
</p>

<p>
            Without peace, a human life is meaningless.'Apara' knowledge gives temporary happiness, but by practicing 'Para' knowledge one gains eternal peace and happiness, which he can find by adopting 'Manoyog Sadhana' under 'SST Programme'. `Sadhana' was adopted even by gods, and forgetting this path they got diverted. Gods had adopted 'Aradhana'(worship) and 'Sadhana' simultaneously to attain power and peace. These gods were once ordinary human beings but became great souls by diligence and zeal. We too can become great powerful people by doing 'Sadhana' with strong will power and become gods for the coming generations. 
</p>
<p>
            `Manyog Sadhana' means total relaxation, giving total rest to mind and body. In this, generally the time of sleep is reduced and students get more time to study. There is no fatigue after work. If human beings are going to learn 'Manyog Sadhana' they can invest their energy for public welfare, thereby living the life of divine souls. "Man alone is god" is my message. Wasting human life is not good, lazy people live life with the support of 'Apara' knowledge. We should attain power with the help of 'Sadhana'. In schools up to universities we get only the knowledge of alphabets to PhD, but in 'Manoyog Sadhana', through great effort, we can attain entire knowledge and become divine souls.
</p>
<p>
             This important 'Manoyog Sadhana' is being attained mysteriously by 'Yogis' living in mountains and caves and they are enjoying it's precious results. Initially, laymen were not able to reach this 'Yoga', but now this ultimate 'Yoga Sadhana' is revealed before all.
</p>
<p>
              My technique is totally based upon the classical form. Usually we do many kind of worships and 'Sadhanas' whose results we get after death or in our next birth, which is not so important. To achieve results in this life, 'Manoyog Sadhana' is the best way to adopt in our daily life. We get immediate results from 'Manoyog Sadhana'. Many people have practical experiences of it. By doing 'Sadhana' twice a day, we get complete results. Doing 'Sadhana' once a day is not futile, one gets its results. To make a worldly person ascetic or to divert students from studies to 'Sadhana' is not my intention. My aim is to make worldly people more responsible and to make students more bright in studies, and people at large more efficient, hard working and people of character, who could live ideal life. Thus my request to everyone is to shun superstitions and adopt classical method of 'Manoyog Sadhana' based on scientific knowledge and make your life meaningful. 
</p>
<p>
              Don't waste your time and energy in futile thinking about next birth or reaching heaven after death. Whatever 'Sadhana' you do, do it diligently adopting reliable method, in this birth only. Shun leisure and adopt diligence and move your life towards progress.
