                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>'Pranav'</b> is also known as <b>'Omkar'</b>. In <b>'Omkar'</b> there are three <b>'Matras'</b> (sounds):
                    <b>"Aa"</b>, <b>"Oo"</b> and <b>"Maa"</b>. In the entire world these three words- 
                    <ol>
                    <li><h5>Aakaar</h5></li>
                    <li><h5>Ookaar</h5></li>
                    <li><h5>Makaar</h5></li>
                    </ol> 
                    exist everywhere. Scientists have proved that all things in this world have been
                    formed from very small particles known as atoms and scientist <b>De Brogli</b> has proved that
                    every solid particle contains waves that causes vibration. As in atom electrons move
                    around nucleus, in the similar manner all planets move around the Sun in their own orbit
                    in the solar system and from them waves are generating. Thus it is said that the power
                    which exists in an atom, the same power is pervading in the universe too. There is only
                    one power in the Universe and the sound of waves emitting from the solar system is also
                    one, but some people call it <b>'Omkar'</b> and some <b>'Aamin'</b>.</p>

                    <p>Our body is a storehouse of living particles. In our body there is perpetual origin
                    and decay of living particles. As the water of the ocean evaporates each moment, in a
                    similar manner living particles in our body are developing and getting destroyed each
                    moment. 35 years ago, <b>Dr. Alvaris</b>, <i>Professor of Berkely University, California in America</i>
                    has proved through an experiment that in a body approximately <b>1022</b> living organisms
                    originate and get destroyed every second. If there is pain in any part of the body it is
                    because that there is a lack of oxygen delivered in that part of body. We should learn the
                    technique by which appropriate amount of oxygen can be delivered to that part of the
                    body to relieve the pain. This technique is in <b>'Manoyog Sadhana'</b>. The moment we sing
                    'Aa', 'Oo' and 'Ma' the waves start emitting energy and cure many diseases and the body
                    is fully charged with energy. This 'Sadhana' is simple and there is no need to give pain to
                    the body. This 'Sadhana' takes 25 minutes. The person doing 'Pranav Sadhana' need
                    not slog on through strenuous efforts. 25 minutes of 'Pranav Sadhana' will give a person
                    a lot of energy equivalent to the heat liberated as a result of 10 kilometer of jogging, thus
                    a person is mentally relaxed and cuts down on food intake.</p>

                    <h3>Method of Pranav Sadhana</h3>
                    <h5>First Step:</h5> 
                    <p>
                    One has to sit on the floor, on sitting mat or on any base with legs
                    folded inside (in 'Padmaasan' or 'Ardh Padamasan'). Back bone and spinal cord should
                    be straight. Sing 'Omkar', with eyes closed, pronouncing 'Akar', at a higher pace, letting
                    the air pass between the teeth, sing 'Ookar' word. In the end, closing both the lips, sing
                    'Makaar' word, pull the stomach inwards and without breathing move the neck down to
                    lock the air movement. Hold the breath as long as possible and then inhale at a stretch,
                    straightening your neck. One should hold the breath for 10 to 15 seconds. Then
                    gradually increase the time to one minute. Thus over all it takes 5 minutes to practice first
                    'Pranava Sadhana'. The time of 4 minutes should be used to relax and for observing the
                    inhale and exhale. Observe the breath coming and going, from which nostril air is inhaled and from which it is exhaled. Sometimes it may appear from right nostril and sometimes from left, and other times from both. We shall repeat this 'Sadhana 'five times. The total process is of 25 minutes which is to be done, for 10 days regularly, morning and evening. 
                    </p>
                    <h5>Second Step:</h5> 
                    <p>
                    From eleventh day onwards, sit with your legs crossed (in 'Padamasan' or 'Ardh Padmasan') with your backbone and spinal cord straight, with eyes closed and pronounce 'Akar' word speedily for 5 seconds ,with your teeth tightened and with full strength of your body, then sing 'Oozing' sound (like the sound helicopter starts). By singing this sound carbon-dioxide of the body is released. After the 'Oozing' sound, air left in the stomach or lungs should be blown outside the mouth by pulling the stomach inside. Bend the neck down and hold your nose with fingers. By holding your nose, remain without breath as long as possible for you, then release your nose, bring your neck up, open your mouth to take full breath (oxygen) inside. This process may take 1 minute. After this close your eyes and concentrate on inhale and exhale for 4 minutes. Total time of this process is 5 minutes. This process should be done 5 times at a stretch. More than 5 times is prohibited. It takes total 25 minutes. This is to be done for 3 months. 
                    </p>
                    <h5>Third Step:</h5>
                    <p>
                    Sit with your legs folded inside (in 'Ardh Padamasan' or 'Padamasan'), backbone and spinal cord straight, eyes closed, sing 'Aakar' and 'Ookar' words for 5 seconds, teeth tightened and exhale carbon dioxide, with such intensity that if we keep our hands 6 inches away from our mouth breath should be felt on it. Blow air from mouth as long as it is possible, pull the stomach inwards, pulling the neck down, holding your nose, and stop breathing as long as possible. When it is difficult to continue without taking breath leave the nose, pull the neck straight, and take long breath. The oxygen will rejuvenate every cell of the body and effluents will be thrown out of body in the form of gases.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                    All these three steps are to be done by sitting on a mat. During 'Sadhana' for 25 minutes neither eyes should be open nor should there be any other movement of the body. This discipline is very essential. Initially one can open the eyes for a while to check the 4 minutes duration, gradually one will get accustomed. 
                    </p>
                    <p><b>
                    This `Sadhana' is prohibited for children less than 12 years, patients of hernia, heart, any person operated within a span of 6 months and ladies for 4-5 days during mensuration period.</b>

                <h3>Benefits acquired from Sadhana</h3>
                    <p>
                    There are scientifically proven theories behind the benefits acquired from 'Sadhana'. As dams are constructed to regulate the water- flow and when gates are opened to release the water, it flushes-off the pollutants and stagnant water. Likewise in 'Pranav Sadhana' the pollutants of the body are flushed off by regulating respiration. The body and mind will be relieved of many ailments. The matter in the body is gradually going to change into energy. The energy is going to flow in one direction and hidden energy is awakened, which is known as 'Kundali Jagriti' in spiritual language. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    By doing this 'Sadhana', <b>genetic characteristics gets purified</b> and <b>hereditary diseases are cured</b>. When energy/power is generated in living particles, the impurities inherent in them get purified. Mental tension is relieved. Mental and other ailments, doctors can't diagnose, will perish forever. Planetary positions which have ill effect on our life also get solved. As ozone layer in the atmosphere protects earth from ultra violet radiation from the sun, similarly the power of this 'Sadhana' widens the aura over the human body and prolongs ones life span.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    By this (Sadhana), the number of <b>heart beat of average man decreases</b> from the normal 72 beats per minute. The age of man is determined by the span between heart beats. When the speed of heart beat becomes less, the life of the heart increases. When a person is angry, the heart beats at a rate of 140 beats per minute. During sexual intercourse the heart beat increases even up to 240. Keeping mind free from vices one can increase heart life. This proves that man can live longer than the time predicted in the horoscope.
