                <h3>Method Of Manoyog Sadhana</h3>
                <p>
                    The most appropriate time for this process, is morning around 4 O'clock, before sun rise, in what we call <b>Brahmh Muhoort</b>. After getting fresh, the learner should sit on sitting mat <i>(or on any chair, if feeling inconvenient)</i> for Sadhana. The process of <b>Sadhana</b> includes three stages, which are to be, performed one after another: 
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Pranav Sadhana</b></li>
                        <li><b>Yog Nidra Part - I with Thought</b> <i>(determination)</i></li>
                        <li><b>Yog Nidra Part - II without Thought</b> <i>(determination)</i></li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This process of three stages takes only one hour. <b>Sadhana</b> should be done in the morning and evening regularly. By this process (Sadhana), there develops <b>'Yogic'</b> power in man, and he gets relieved of physical and mental ailments. Thus the person undergoing this <b>'Sadhana'</b>, with utmost devotion and sincerity will be relieved of serious physical ailments or any hereditary diseases which couldn't be cured by medical sciences.

                <h3>Sadhana is essential for all human beings</h3>
                <p>
                    It is not only for saints and sadhus. A human being has four <b>'Purushartha'</b> to achieve - <b>'Kaama'</b>, <i>(Desire)</i> <b>'Artha'</b> <i>(Money)</i>, <b>'Dharma'</b> <i>(Right Path)</i> and <b>'Moksha'</b> <i>(Salvation)</i> . This is known as <b>'Aytan'</b> <i>(Aaytan means passing through one stage into another)</i>. When a thought originates in human mind, he earns <b>'Artha'</b> <i>(money)</i> for its fulfillment. Today all men in this world are struggling to earn money. No one is proceeding towards <b>'Dharma'</b> <i>(Right Path)</i>. As long as, we are engaged in the fulfillment of our desires, we can never proceed towards the path of
                    <b>'Dharma'</b> and <b>'Moksha'</b>. Thus human being instead of fulfillment of desires should
                    proceed towards the path of <b>'Dharma'</b> and <b>'Moksha'</b> with the support of truth. For moving
                    on this path <b>'Sadhana'</b> is essential not only for saints but for ordinary worldly people, as
                    these people are more engrossed in worldly affairs and are encircled with mental
                    tensions and many other ailments. Thus <b>'Manoyog Sadhana'</b> is a bliss and people
                    adopting it will attain peace.
