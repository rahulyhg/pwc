                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                In 'SST Programme', the process of `Samadhi' is very important The trainee learning `Samadhi' process is first trained to regulate nerves, conscious and sub conscious mind, intellect and ego for seven days. Then the process of `Samadhi' starts on eighth day.

                <p>
                As the field is prepared for the seeds to be sown, similarly on eighth day the seed of `Samadhi' is sown. For reaching the state of `Samadhi', the person has to change his life style, because the 15 minutes of 'Samadhi' practice is based upon daily routine. If the person is leading the false life style 'Samadhi' will not produce the desired benefit. Simply by amending the daily routine, and practicing 'Samadhi' regularly one can achieve tremendous gains. After improving daily routine, one can practice 'Samadhi' without any effort.

                <p>
                 Being in a state of undisturbed mind is the 'ultimate state'. By adding certain situations in life, one can be in the state of 'Samadhi' effortlessly. As I'm like father and mother for the entire world with the same dedication `Sadhana' should be adopted. `Samadhi' is to be done by total dedication and there will be a feeling of ultimate joy. One who is in this state and understands the responsibility for the entire world, has the most peaceful state of mind and there is no discrimination of caste, creed, cult, province for him. The feeling of equality is generated, towards all.
                <p>
                 "Every things is O.K.", is the feeling which is the state of equilibrium. And the feeling that "nothing is O.K." is the state of servitude of mind, and it takes us towards dissatisfaction. The fact is that the entire world is working in proper order and this is the 'cycle of the Universe'. One has to change his attitude towards this philosophy. Therefore before going for `Samadhi' one should convey this message that 'Every thing is O.K.' to the mind. 
                 </p>
                <p>
                "I am nothing" is an ego-less state. Ego is a narrow state of mind and one who compares himself with others and thinks biased, entangles himself into problems. If a person/trainee adopts 3 points mentioned below for a year or s o , he can always remain in the state of `Samadhi' 
                </p>
                <ol>
                <li> <b>Hungry:</b> Before practicing 'Samadhi', person should be hungry and never sit after the meal. </li>
                <li> <b>Feeling tired:</b> Hunger and tiredness of body should be there. 'Samadhi' can't take place just after the sleep. </li>
                <li> <b>3 The state of being without any desire:</b> One should not desire any gains from 'Samadhi'. If we keep any desire during `Samadhi', the mind will not be neutral and there will be diversion and deviation of the energy towards that want. There should not be any reaction to whatever is happening around you and there should be a sense of detachment. One has to be like a dead body during `Samadhi', without paying any attention towards whatever is happening around you. Hence, if we go through the three stages mentioned above , `Samadhi' will take place automatically. </li>
